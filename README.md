### Steps to Include Images:

1. **Store Images in the Repository:**
   - Create a folder named `images` in the root of your project (or any other directory you prefer).
   - Place your images in this folder.

2. **Link Images in `README.md`:**
   - Use the relative path to link the images. For example, if your image is stored in an `images` folder in the root of the project:
     ```markdown
     ![Home Page](images/home.png)
     ```

3. **Commit and Push Changes:**
   - Save your `README.md` file.
   - Add, commit, and push your changes to the repository:
     ```sh
     git add README.md images/home.png images/dashboard.png
     git commit -m "Add project description and images to README"
     git push origin main
     ```

After these steps, your `README.md` should display the project description and images correctly when viewed on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.
